## Tutorial for Java Spring + React + MySQL Fullstack Development Project

Watch the following video for understanding of what we will do for the next few weeks:

## General Folder Structure

The backend and database programmings will be done in "schedulersystem" folder with Java Spring Boot Framework.

I have added MySQL dependencies, so managing database will be easy after we create the necessary classes and tables during Design Doc Meeting

The frontend programmings will be done in "schedulerfrontend" folder with ReactJS. We can add CSS Tailwind or other frameworks later in this folder to make websites pretty.

One thing to watch out is whenever we add new depedencies, libraries, packages, frameworks, etc., please write it down somewhere and let us know. These files will not be pushed to the GitHub most of the times because of .gitignore file, and it is also important that we all have same version for these packages and stuff.

At the moment, we are using almost all the recent versions for everything: openjdk-17 (Java 17), node v17.5.0 (this may later change to 16), ...

## Alternative to Java Sprint Boot + React + MySQL

Alternative idea that I have is MySQL + React (or it can be normal HTML/CSS/JS) + WebSocket + Java (<-- normal one we learned in class)

In this option, creating connection between client and server will be more confusing, and more programmings may be required in the server. However, the implementation in Java may be more familiar to what we have done in class, which is better.
